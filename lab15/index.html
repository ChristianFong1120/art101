					<div id = challenge>
					<h4><u>Challenge</u></h4>
					<p> This lab involved working with AJAX to pull data from an API.
						</p>
					</div>


					<div id = problems>
					<h4><u>Problems</u></h4>
					<p> We ran into no issues when completing this lab as Christian has had prior programming experience. We pulled a JSON object from our API, then placed the "value" of the JSON object into our webpage.
						</div>
					</p>



				<div id = results>
					<h4><u>Results</u></h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab, and used Jquery to change our output div's html to the "value" delivered by the JSON object.
					</p>

		<div id = code>

						<h4><u>Output</u></h4>
								<button id= "my-button"> Click me for a Chuck Norris Fact </button>
								<br>
								<br>

						<div id = output>


								<p> A fact will appear here</p>
							
						</div>
						<br>
						<br>
									<img src = "img/Capture.JPG" id = pic>
							</div>

							<div id = caption>

								<p>We created a function to get our Ajax, and called it when our button was clicked. Upon successful connection, we changed our output div's html to be the Chuck Norris fact provided by the "value" in our fetched JSON object.
