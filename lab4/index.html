			<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding </h1>
				<hr>
				<div id = info>
					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved creating pseudocode for an everyday task. Pseudocode can be defined as a high level set of steps that are used to complete a task. In programming, this is common to do when planning out an algorithm without coding it up completely.
						</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. Having done pseudocode in a programming environment a number of times before, he was able to explain the concept well and thorough to Michael. <p>

					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We decided to pesudocode cooking a steak. We overall felt pretty good about our pesudocode, as Christian loves cooking steaks and has the steps ingrained in his head. This lab gave us no difficulties and we had no problem delivering the pesudocode as well as updating our website to github to reflect our new changes

				<pre><code>
					Grab steak from fridge
					Pat dry steak
					Oil and season steak
					Place steak on hot pan
					While steak is not fully cooked
					  wait for it to cook for X amount of minutes (cook time dependent on steak thickness)
					  flip steak
					baste steak with butter and garlic
					flip steak and baste otherside
					let steak rest for 5-10 minutes
				</pre></code>

					<p> Above is the result of our pseudocode for cooking a steak. </p>
				</div>
				<div class = pseudo>
					<pre><code>
					is_prime(modulus n, iterations)
					Write n - 1=2^s * r such that r is odd
					For iteration from 1 to iterations
						Val = random num in range (2, n - 2)
						Y = pow_mod(val, r, n)
						If y isn't 1 or n - 1
							J = 1
							While j is less than  s - 1 and y is not n - 1
							Do pow_mod(y, 2, n) for y
							If y is 1
								It is not prime
							Inc j by 1
						If y is not n - 1
							It is not prime
					If it makes it out of test, it is prime
					</div>
					</pre></code>

						<p> Above is other pseduo code Chrstian has done in the past. The above is for determining primality of large (greater than 64 bit) integers imported from the gmp library in C. </p>
