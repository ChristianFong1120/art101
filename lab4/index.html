			<h1> Lab 4: Pseudocoding </h1>
				<hr>
				<div id = info>
					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved creating pseudocode for an everyday task. Pseudocode can be defined as a high level set of steps that are used to complete a task. In programming, this is common to do when planning out an algorithm without coding it up completely.
						</p>
					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. Having done pseudocode in a programming environment a number of times before, he was able to explain the concept well and thorough to Michael. <p>

					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We decided to pesudocode cooking a steak. We overall felt pretty good about our pesudocode, as Christian loves cooking steaks and has the steps ingrained in his head. This lab gave us no difficulties and we had no problem delivering the pesudocode as well as updating our website to github to reflect our new changes
