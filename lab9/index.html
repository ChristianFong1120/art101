					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved manipulating DOM elements with JavaScript.
						</p>

					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. This was very synonymous with past object oriented programming he has done in the past.
					</p>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab and created the javascript file with little difficulty. We successfully manipulated and fetched elements using JavaScript.
					</p>

						<div id = code>
						<h4>Tour of code</h4>
								<img src = "img/Capture.JPG" id = pic>

							</div>

							<div id = caption>
								<p>
									We first started by fetching an html element by the tag "info", which is the div detailing out efforts. We then created basic elements of "p" tag and of "button" tag. We then edited
									their inner html, changing their text content. From there we appended it to our fetched html element from earlier, adding it to our wbepage. After, we used js to modify css elements such as adding a border
									to our code screenshot, as well as changing this caption color!
