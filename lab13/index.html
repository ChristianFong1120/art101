					<div id = challenge>
					<h4><u>Challenge</u></h4>
					<p> This lab involved working with conditionals and loops in JavaScript
						</p>
					</div>


					<div id = problems>
					<h4><u>Problems</u></h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. This was very synonymous with past object oriented programming he has done in the past.
					</p>

				<div id = results>
					<h4><u>Results</u></h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab and created the javascript file with little difficulty. We successfully used JQuery to fetch a button, using its click to call our loop function.
					</p>
					<h4><u>Output</u></h4>
						<button id= "my-button"> Click me to call a function! </button>
					<div id = output>

								<p>
									We first started by creating a counter variable, which we would increase every loop iteration. Everytime the counter was divisible by its respective digit, we output the respective phrase matching these numbers. We then used JQuery to
									listen for a button click event to call our function.
