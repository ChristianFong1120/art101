					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved working with events and calling a function when a certain event occurs.
						</p>

					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. This was very synonymous with past object oriented programming he has done in the past.
					</p>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab and created the javascript file with little difficulty. We successfully caught the button click event and outputted a sorted name to our html file via JavaScript.
					</p>
					<br>
					<button id = my-button>Click Me To Run Name Sort!</button>

					<h4>Sorted Name: </h4>
					<div id = output>

					</div>
						</div>

						<div id = code>
						<h4>Tour of code</h4>
								<img src = "img/Capture.JPG" id = pic>

							</div>

							<div id = caption>
								<p>
									We first started by fetching out button element we created in our html file. We then declared our name sort function. In our function we sort the name and then output it to out HTML file by changing the inner html. Finally we call the function
									by listening for a button click, and calling the function when said event occurs.
