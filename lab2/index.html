        <p>My name is Christian Fong and I am a student at UC Santa Cruz pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. My goal is to apply hard skills learned throughout
             my education, as well as gain experience in a real-time work environment. I hope that through internships and other applications I can
             further strengthen my skill set and eventually find full time employment as a full stack software developer.
        </p>
