        <p>My name is Christian Fong and I am a student at UC Santa Cruz pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. My goal is to apply hard skills learned throughout
             my education, as well as gain experience in a real-time work environment. I hope that through internships and other applications I can
             further strengthen my skill set and eventually find full time employment as a full stack software developer. My favorite activities include playing
             basketball, coding, working on cars, playing video games, playing with my dog, and cooking.
        </p>

               <p>My name is Michael Riley and I am pursuing a bachelors in film.
                  I am a third year and hope to graduate next spring. My goal is to use the skills Iâ€™ve learned to become one of the
                   best documentary film makers within the action sports world. I hope for this class to truly help me within that field.
