			<h3>Lab 7 - Functions</h3>

				<br>

<div id = content>

					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved writing a function that took user input and performed some type of string manipulation.
						</p>

					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. We simply manipulated the string iteratively, manipulating each char one by one via for loop. The function switches the case of each alphabetical character in the input string.
					</p>
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab and created the javascript function with little difficulty. We successfully integrated thr script into or website as well as ensured functionality of the script.
					</p>


						</div>
					<div id = script>
						<h4>Script Output</h4>
						<script src = "js/lab.js"></script>
					</div>

						<br>
						<br>
						<div id = code>
						<h4>Tour of code</h4>
								<img src = "img/code.png" id = pic>

							</div>

							<div id = caption>
								<p> The function identifies the ascii value of each char in the string, then adds or subtracts 32 (the upper/lowercase equivalent of the char) and creates a new string from it.
