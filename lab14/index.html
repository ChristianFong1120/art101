					<h4><u>Challenge</u></h4>
					<p> This lab involved debugging old labs we submitted in the past.
						</p>

					<div id = problems>
					<h4><u>Problems</u></h4>
					<p> We debugged our old lab 12, in which we worked with loops and wrote a sorting hat function. Our bug involved the way the function result was outputted to our html page. Rather than printing the result under
						the output heading, it would replace it as a whole. We found the issue to be that we used Jquery to change the inner html of the output div as whole, which itself included the heading. To fix this, we created a sub div within our output div, and placed our function output
						in that div's inner html.

						</div>
					</p>



				<div id = results>
					<h4><u>Results</u></h4>
					<p> We ran into 0 issues with this lab and debugged our old lab perfectly.
