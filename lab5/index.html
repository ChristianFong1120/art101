			<h3>Lab 5 - Data Types and Variables </h3>
<div id = content>
				<div id = info>
					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved writing our first JavaScript code, first in the console, then in a .js file. We were tasked to write a program to describe the make, model, year, color, and age of our car.
						</p>

					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. Though he had no experience with JavaScript, he found it interesting that the language does not require explicit declaration of data types at instantiation, similar to that of Python. <p>

					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We decided to describe Christian's car in the JavaScript program. Overall we had no difficulties as declaring variables and printing them to output is a very simple task. The output is below:	<p>


						</div>
					<div id = script>
						<h4>Script Output</h4>
						<script src = "js/lab.js"></script>
					</div>
					<div id = car>
							<img src = "img/car.png" id = pic>
