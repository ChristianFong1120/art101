					<h4>Challenge</h4>
					<p> This lab involved writing arrays and objects in JavaScript code, first in the console, then in a .js file. We were tasked to instantiate an array of our forms of transportation and an object detailing our main vehicle.
						</p>

					<h4>Problems</h4>
					<p>This lab presented us with no problems as Christian has prior programming experience. Arrays and objects are common throughout all languages, although with varying syntax for instantiation.
					<h4>Results</h4>
					<p> We decided to describe Christian's car in the JavaScript program. Overall we had no difficulties as declaring arrays, objects and printing them to output is a very simple task. The output is below:	<p>
