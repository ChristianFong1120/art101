			<h1> Lab 3: File Structures </h1>

				<div id = info>
					<h4>Subject </h4>
					<p> The subject of this lab is to gain a stronger understanding of file structures and the way computers
						organize files. This is achieved by linking multiple html files in different
						locations to each other through links and the "a href" tag. </p>

					<h4>What is a File Structure?</h4>
					<p> One can imagine a file structure as a tree of sorts, where the each folder is a different branch amongst
						the same tree. The root of the tree is the root directory, and going up the tree is synonymous
						with going down the file structure.
						Each branch can be imagined as a folder and each subranch is a subfolder. <p>

					<h4>Our Experience:</h4>
					<p> Overall, we encountered very little difficulty with this lab as both of us are very tech savy and familar
						 with computers and file architecture. Christian has worked with file structures many times before during
						 coursework as a Computer Science student, and Michael has
						worked with files when working with and editing documentaries.<p>
